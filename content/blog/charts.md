## **Learning from Those Who’ve Gone Before You**

### **What Nautical Charts Teach Us About Wisdom, Mentorship, and Avoiding Life’s Hidden Hazards**

I recently completed my captain’s license, and one of the most challenging—and surprisingly rewarding—parts of the process was learning how to accurately read nautical charts.
Not just glancing at them.
Not just following a line on a screen.
But truly understanding the symbols, warnings, depths, and hazards hidden in what often looks like open, inviting water.
It didn’t take long to realize something important:
Charts don’t exist to tell you where to go.
**They exist to warn you where not to go.**
And that lesson extends far beyond sailing.

### **The Danger of What You Can’t See**
From the helm, the ocean often looks calm and forgiving. Blue water stretches out in every direction. Nothing about the surface suggests danger.
But charts tell a different story.
Reefs just below the surface.
Shoals that can stop you cold.
Wrecks marked by a small symbol—evidence that someone else didn’t see the danger in time.
Life works the same way.
Some of the most damaging hazards aren’t obvious:

- Subtle compromises
- Unchecked pride
- Isolation
- Misplaced priorities
- Shortcuts that look harmless at first
  
If you rely only on what you can see, you’ll miss what matters most.

### **Charts Are Wisdom Preserved**

Every marking on a nautical chart represents experience—often learned the hard way.
Soundings taken over time.
Hazards recorded after incidents.
Safe passages discovered through repetition and care.
Charts are wisdom preserved so the next sailor doesn’t have to pay full price.
That’s exactly what mentors, scripture, and trusted counsel are meant to be in our lives.
They don’t exist to limit freedom.
They exist to protect it.

### **Mentors: Living Charts**

A good mentor is like a chart that talks back.
They’ve navigated waters you haven’t reached yet.
They recognize dangers you don’t see.
They know when to slow you down—and when to encourage you forward.
Ignoring mentors doesn’t make you independent.
It makes you vulnerable.
The wisest sailors lean harder on charts when entering unfamiliar waters.
The same should be true of us in new seasons of life.

### **Scripture: A Chart That Doesn’t Change**

Charts are only useful if they’re accurate and trusted.
Scripture functions the same way.
It doesn’t shift with trends.
It doesn’t bend to emotion.
It doesn’t change based on convenience.
It consistently reveals:

- Where danger hides
- What leads to life
- Which paths look right but end poorly
  
In a world full of opinions, scripture provides a fixed reference—much like a chart that remains reliable no matter how often it’s unfolded.

### **Tools That Keep You Oriented**

Modern sailors don’t rely on charts alone. They use multiple tools:

- Plotters
- Bearings
- GPS
- Depth sounders
  
Not because they lack confidence—but because **redundancy increases safety.**
Life benefits from the same approach:

- Wise friends
- Honest feedback
- Reflection
- Prayer
- Accountability
The goal isn’t certainty.
It’s awareness.

### **Pride Is the Most Common Hazard**

In sailing, one of the biggest risks is crowding the reef—sailing just a little closer than recommended because it looks safe.
In life, pride does the same thing.
It whispers:

- “I don’t need advice.”
- “That won’t happen to me.”
- “I’ve got this.”
  
Most wrecks don’t happen because charts were wrong.
**They happen because charts were ignored.**

### **Passing Wisdom Forward**

One of the responsibilities of earning experience—whether at sea or in life—is passing it on.
Charts are shared so others can navigate safely.
Wisdom is shared so others don’t repeat unnecessary mistakes.
Our stories—successes and failures—become charts for those who follow us:

Our children.
Our teams.
Our communities.

**What we choose to share may one day keep someone else off the rocks.**

### **Final Thought: Charts Are an Act of Humility**

Using charts is a quiet admission:
I don’t know everything—and I don’t have to.

They don’t remove storms.
They don’t guarantee easy passage.
They don’t make decisions for you.

But they help you avoid hazards you never needed to discover firsthand.
And in sailing—and in life—that kind of wisdom is invaluable.
