## **They say the days are long, but the years are short**

I always heard that phrase… and nodded along.  
Now that my wife and I are officially empty nesters, I **feel** it in a way I never could before.

Looking back, I’m honestly shocked at how fast it all went.

That doesn’t mean it was easy.

There were seasons we weren’t sure we’d survive:

- sleepless nights with a sick child  
- potty training boys (enough said)  
- the teenage years that tested everyone’s patience and faith  

Somehow, by God’s grace, we were blessed with three incredible kids. They are, without question, what I’m most proud of in this life. And if we’re being honest, most of the credit goes to my wife.

## The Videos That Told the Truth

Over the holidays, my father-in-law pulled out old family videos he’s captured over the years. They were incredible—beach trips, holidays, birthdays, laughter.

But there was one thing that became painfully obvious.

I was missing.

Either I was on another business trip… or I was physically there but mentally somewhere else—trying to close *the most important quarter in the company’s history*. Again.

Oh, what I would give to go back now and be more present.

At the time, I justified it. I told myself I was working hard to give my family a better life.

But looking back, I can’t help but ask the harder question:

**Do things actually provide a better life?**  
And what did my actions really teach my kids?

## The Cost of Constant Urgency

After nearly 30 years of grinding in the medical device world—where you’re only as good as your last quarter—I still struggle to fully relax.

It was deadline after deadline. Pressure after pressure.  
That mindset doesn’t just shut off.

Sailing changed that for me.

It became the one kind of vacation where I *had* to disconnect.

When we first started going to the British Virgin Islands, cell service barely existed. No calls. No emails. No “just one more thing.”

And those trips—those unplugged moments—became some of our most meaningful family memories.

Real conversations.  
Shared adventures.  
Laughter without distraction.

## Why This Matters Now

Those experiences planted a seed.

Today, my hope is to help other families create that same space—to step away from the noise, reconnect with one another, and be intentional about the short window we have to shape and mold our kids into the men and women God created them to be.

My wife and kids still joke with me to this day:

> *“One more email.”*

Apparently, I said that a lot.

And here’s the truth—I know you want to spend more time with your kids. You don’t need convincing. You just need a reminder.

## Don’t Put It Off

- So don’t delay it.
- Not one more email.  
- Not one more quarter.  

The time is now.

**Be present. Create memories that last**
