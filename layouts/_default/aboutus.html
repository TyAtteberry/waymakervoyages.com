          <h3>Who We Are</h3>
          <p>
            At WayMaker Voyages, we craft intentional sailing experiences in the British Virgin Islands that go far beyond a typical vacation. Founded by seasoned sailors and passionate travel designers, we believe the most meaningful journeys are the ones where every detail is thoughtfully planned—so you’re free to be fully present with the people who matter most.
          </p>
          <p>
            We handle the logistics, the planning, and the flow of the week, allowing space for something deeper to unfold. Each voyage is custom-designed around your family or group, blending adventure, rest, and purpose into an experience that feels both effortless and unforgettable.
          </p>
          <h3>More Than a Vacation</h3>
          <p>
            WayMaker Voyages is not about checking destinations off a list. It’s about creating space for insight, connection, and growth. Throughout the week, we intentionally weave in moments that help people better understand themselves and one another—often through guided conversations and tools like the ProScan Assessment.
          </p>
          <p> 
          Families gain a clearer picture of one another’s God-given strengths, communication styles, and natural wiring. Parents often leave with a deeper appreciation for how each child is uniquely designed, and children feel seen and valued for who they are. These insights don’t end when the trip does—they become part of how families relate long after returning home.
          </p>
          <h3>Purposeful for Families, Leaders, and Pastors</h3>
          <p>
            Our voyages are equally impactful for pastors, business leaders, and leadership teams. Time away from daily pressures, combined with intentional reflection and shared adventure, creates a powerful environment for clarity and alignment. Leaders gain fresh perspective on how to leverage one another’s strengths, communicate more effectively, and lead with greater understanding and unity.
          </p>
          <p> 
          Whether it’s a family seeking reconnection, a pastoral team discerning next steps, or business leaders looking to strengthen trust and collaboration, WayMaker Voyages creates the conditions for meaningful breakthrough.
          </p>

          <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
          <p>
            We believe travel should transform you. That’s why we don’t simply arrange trips—we design experiences. Experiences that slow life down, invite honest conversation, spark wonder through God’s creation above and below the water, and strengthen relationships through shared challenges and joy.
          </p>
          <p>Every sail, meal, adventure, and quiet moment is curated with intention. The result is not just a week in the islands, but a shared story—one that families and groups return to for years, remembering not only where they went, but who they became together.
          </p>
          <h5>WayMaker Voyages isn’t just a getaway.
It’s an experience with purpose.</h5>
